Vendor tree for use in building Team Baked Black Bean 6, based on the Unified CM10 project trees. Modified to work with Black Bean. 

Of note, the kernel doesn't always build properly inline, consider building separate or using the latest kernel binary of Balthesaur available in the Unified CM10 builds.

You will still need to sync with the Baked source before using this tree, then add this tree where appropriate.
